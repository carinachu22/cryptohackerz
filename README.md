This CTF challenge adapted the characters from Spy x Family anime. For those who have watched it, this will be fun! 
For those who didn't, here are some details of the main characters. 
1. Anya is a 5 year old little girl who likes to watch a spy tv show, and will sometimes create ciphers.
2. Damian is a boy in the same class as Anya and they are always bickering. 
3. Anya has a fluffy white pet dog called Bond!
We highly recommend you to go watch the anime too as it is so cute 

## Introduction 
On the last day of school, Damian was mocking Anya for her ugly artwork that she did and Anya got angry. Damian was puzzled why she suddenly teared up and ran away. 2 hours later, Anya came running back to him and thrusted letter into his hands, and ran away again. 

Even more confused, Damian opened the letter to reveal some undecipherable words. Damian is asking you for help! Please go to challenge 1 to view the letter and help damian decipher what anya wrote.
